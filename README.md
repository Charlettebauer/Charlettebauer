Hi there 👋

👩‍💻 My name is Charlette Bauer and I am a full-stack software engineer with a focus on front-end applications. I am looking for a position where I can combine the creativity I developed as an artist, the critical thinking I expanded as a registered nurse and the years of problem-solving I utilized as a top level manager.

📚 When I am not coding (which isn't very often), I love to read historical fiction. The funny thing is, I can't leave it at that, I have to research the information in the book to see if it is really historically accurate!

📜 I am a life-long learner and enjoy working and learning from others!

❤️ My desire has always been trying to figure out ways to help people. I've decided it doesn't always have to be a grand gesture but consistent small acts of kindness matter just as much!

🌼 I would love to hear from you! Reach out to me on Linkedin at https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlettebauer/.
